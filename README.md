# Google Foobar Solutions
Author: Helen Dun

The Google Foobar is a hidden test Google gives to programmer with search histories of keywords that Google is looking for in a programmer. It consists of 5 Levels of tests, with each suite of tests being more difficult. There are 1 Level-1 test, 2 Level-2 tests, 3 Level-3 tests, 2 Level-4 tests and 1 Level-5 test. While I did not think to record some of the earlier tests, the tests I did record are described below by their name, level, problem and my solution. Descriptions of the more complex problems are in their respective folders.
